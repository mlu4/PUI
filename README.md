# Assignment 5 Web HTML and CSS Prototypes

## Extra Credit Pages

On top of the home page, product browsing page, and one product detail page, I also implemented:
- About page (from navigation bar)
- Menu (below the home page)
- Product detail pages for all products (from the "View Details" button on the product browsing page)
- Contact page (from the "send us a message" link in the footer)
- Shopping cart pop-up (from "add to cart" button on product detail pages)
- Checkout page (from "checkout" button on shopping cart pop-up)
